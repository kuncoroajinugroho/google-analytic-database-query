**Google Analytics Database Query: From Raw Data to Data Mart**

Processing Google Analytics data from its raw form into a structured data mart involves multiple stages, including data collection, transformation, aggregation, and optimization. Below is a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

**1. Data Collection (Raw Data Stage)** 

Google Analytics (GA) collects event-based user activity from websites or apps, such as:

• Page views, clicks, form submissions, transactions.

• Session data, user identifiers, and traffic sources.

• Device, browser, and geolocation information.

• This data is typically stored in Google BigQuery if GA360 is used, or retrieved via Google Analytics API.

**2. Data Ingestion & Storage (Landing Zone)**

 • The raw event-level data is loaded into a staging table in BigQuery or another database.

 • Each event includes timestamp, user ID, session ID, event type, and metadata.

 • The schema is often denormalized and structured in nested JSON format.

**3. Data Cleaning & Transformation (ETL Process)**

Using SQL queries or ETL tools (dbt, Dataflow, Airflow), raw data is:
	
 • Flattened (if stored as nested JSON).

 • Cleaned (removing null values, handling missing data).

 • Standardized (converting time zones, unifying event names).

 • Joined with external datasets (CRM, eCommerce sales).

**4. Data Aggregation & Modeling**

The transformed data is aggregated into meaningful dimensions and metrics, such as:
	
 • Sessions per user, conversion rates, revenue per session.

 • Traffic source performance (UTM analysis).

 • Customer journey tracking (multi-touch attribution).

 • Aggregated data is stored in a fact table (e.g., fact_sessions, fact_events) and dimension tables (e.g., dim_users, dim_devices).

**5. Data Mart Creation & Optimization**

A data mart is built for faster querying and reporting by:
	
 • Creating summary tables for marketing, sales, or product teams.

 • Optimizing performance with partitioning and clustering in BigQuery.

 • Ensuring data security and role-based access to sensitive data.
